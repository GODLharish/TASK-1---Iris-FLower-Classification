# TASK-1---Iris-FLower-Classification
Iris Flower Classification project using machine learning to predict Iris species based on sepal and petal dimensions. It includes data preprocessing, model training (using algorithms like Decision Trees, k-NN, SVM), and performance evaluation. Clone the repo and install dependencies to get started.
